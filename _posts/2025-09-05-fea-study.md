## Wall Mount Bracket FEA Study

## Objective:
Evaluate the structural performance of one-fin vs two-fin wall mount bracket under a 200N load. Compare two mounting assumptions:
1. Surface-fixed mount (bracket welded or full constrained at the wall plate)
2. Hole-fixed mount (bracket attached via screws through bolt holes)
